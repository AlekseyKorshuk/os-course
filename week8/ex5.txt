The difference between a physical and a virtual address

Physical address:
- An address of physical memory.
- Consistently resembles the memory's real structure.
- The number of physical addresses = the total memory capacity.
- If separate processes are not utilized different physical addresses, they would collide.

Virtual address:
- Viewed by process.
- The number of addresses may not be equal (usually not equal) to the memory capacity.
- In memory management unit they mapped to physical locations, so different processes might both have byte with the same adress.
- Overbooking - will reduce memory for a process if it is not used.
